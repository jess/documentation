  %h1 Deployment

  %br

  %p
    Once you are satisfied by your site, it is time to deploy it on an online instance of the LocomotiveCMS.

.alert.info-alert
  %strong Important.
  The only requirement is to have somewhere (it can be online or locally) a running engine. Check out our
  %a{ :href => '/installation' } installation procedure
  for more information.

%h3 1. Edit your deployment settings

%br

.alert.info-alert
  We assume that your LocomotiveEditor sites are located under ~/Documents/LocomotiveCMS/sites. If not, please correct it accordingly.
  %br
  %br
  %strong Important.
  Make sure your locomotive engine and your site have the same locales.  
  The Locomotive engine defaults to `en`, so to keep english as your locale, open my_first_website/config/site.yml and 
  %br
  change locales: [en, fr, de] to locales: [en]

%pre
  cd ~/Documents/LocomotiveCMS/sites
  mate my_first_website/config/deploy.yml

%p Here is what your deploy.yml file should look like:

%pre
  :plain
    development:
      host: dev.example.com
      email: john@doe.net
      password: easyone
    staging:
      host: staging.example.com
      email: john@doe.net
      password: easyone
    production:
      host: www.example.com
      email: john@doe.net
      password: easyone

%p
  The email/password credentials are owned by one of your
  %strong LocomotiveCMS administrator accounts.

.alert.alert-info
  You can as many targets (test, ...etc) as you want.

%h3 2. Push

%br

%h4 the whole site:

%br

%pre
  locomotive_editor push --name=my_first_website --resources=all --target=staging

%p or

%pre
  locomotive_editor push -n my_first_website -r all -t staging

%br

%h4 only a specify type of resource:

%br

%p In some cases, you do not want to push all the whole site. For instance, if you have just modified a single page, you do not need to push the assets too.

%p
  The available resource types are:
  %strong theme_assets, snippets, content_types and pages.

%p Example:

%pre
  locomotive_editor push --name=my_first_website --resources=pages --target=staging

%br

%h4 when the resource already exists within your target engine

%br

%p
  By default, the push command will not let you erase your target resources. That is why you will see the "skipped" label beside your resource name if you try to run the push command.

%p
  Unless you force it:

%pre
  locomotive_editor push --name=my_first_website --resources=pages --target=staging --force
